Hello dearest reader, welcome to my blog!

I go by the internet handle of _Teisybe_ and I hail from the land of the rain - [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania) ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹.

During the day - I work as a software developer in your regular run of the mill code shop, but during evenings and weekends, I like to partake in various hobbies of mine. And this is where this blog comes in. To serve as an outlet for me to write about my hobbies, of which there are many - electronics, software development, reverse engineering and general tomfoolery with technology.

If you wish to contact me, you can do so using these links:
